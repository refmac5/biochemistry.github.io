    <p>Cholesterol and related sterols are present in the membranes of most
      eukaryotic cells<br>
      Modulate fluidity and permeability<br>
      Thicken the plasma membrane<br>
      Most bacteria lack sterols<br>
      Mammals obtain cholesterol from food or synthesize it de novo in the liver
      <br>
      Cholesterol, bound to proteins, is transported to tissues via blood
      vessels<br>
      Cholesterol in low-density lipoproteins tends to deposit and clog arteries
      <br>
      Many hormones are derivatives of sterols</p>
