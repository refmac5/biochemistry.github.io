    <p>Steroids are oxidized derivatives of sterols<br>
      Steroids have the sterol nucleus, but lack the alkyl chain found in
      cholesterol&nbsp; <br>
      More polar than cholesterol<br>
      Steroid hormones are synthesized from cholesterol in gonads and adrenal
      glands<br>
      They are carried through the body in the bloodstream, usually attached to
      carrier proteins<br>
      Many of the steroid hormones are male and female sex hormones&nbsp; <br>
