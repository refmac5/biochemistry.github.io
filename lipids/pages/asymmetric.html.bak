    <p>Every component of the membrane exhibits asymmetry<br>
      Lipids (Some lipids are found preferably “inside”<br>
      Some lipids are found preferably “outside”)</p>
    <p>Outer and inner leaflets have different lipid compositions<br>
      <br>
      Individual peripheral membrane proteins are only associated with one side
      of the membrane</p>
    <p>Integral membrane proteins have different domains on different sides of
      the membrane.</p>
    <p>Specific lipid modification of proteins targets the protein to a specific
      leaflet</p>
    <p>Carbohydrates Only on the outside of cells</p>
    Electrically polarized (inside negative ~ –60mV)
