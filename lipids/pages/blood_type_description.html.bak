    <p>The blood groups are determined in part by the type of sugars located on
      the head groups in glycosphingolipids.&nbsp; <br>
      The structure of sugar is determined by an expression of specific
      glycosyltransferases&nbsp; <br>
      Individuals with no active glycosyltransferase will have the O antigen<br>
      Individuals with a glycosyltransferase that transfers an
      N-acetylgalactosamine group have A blood group<br>
      Individuals with a glycosyltransferase that transfers a galactose group
      have B blood group</p>
