    <p>The saturated chain tends to adopt extended conformations <br>
      The double bonds in natural unsaturated fatty acids are commonly in cis
      configuration, which kinks the chain<br>
      Saturated fatty acids pack in a fairly orderly way<br>
      extensive favorable interactions<br>
      Unsaturated cis fatty acid pack less orderly due to the kink<br>
      less-extensive favorable interactions<br>
      It takes less thermal energy to disrupt disordered packing of unsaturated
      fatty acids:<br>
      unsaturated cis fatty acids have a lower melting point</p>
