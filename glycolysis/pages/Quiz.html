  <body id="s">1. One consequence of starvation is a reduction in muscle mass.
    What happens to the muscle proteins?
    <p>2. The conversion of glucose to pyruvate cannot sustain living cells
      without further conversion of pyruvate either by respiration or
      fermentation. What is the main reason?</p>
    <p>3. The conversion of glucose into glucose 6-phosphate, which must occur
      in the breakdown of glucose, is thermodynamically unfavorable
      (endergonic). How do cells overcome this problem?</p>
    <p>4. Why is it important that gluconeogenesis is not the exact reversal of
      glycolysis?</p>
