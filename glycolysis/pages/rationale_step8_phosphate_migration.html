    <p>Rationale: <br>
      - Be able to form high-energy phosphate compound </p>
    <p>Mutases catalyze the (apparent) migration of functional groups </p>
    <p>One of the active site histidines is post-translationally modified to
      phosphohistidine</p>
    <p>Phosphohistidine donates its phosphate to O2 before retrieving another
      phosphate from O3 <br>
      - 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate intermediate<br>
      - Note that the phosphate from the substrate ends up bound to the enzyme
      at the end of the reaction</p>
    <p>Thermodynamically unfavorable/reversible<br>
      - Reactant concentration kept high by PGK to push forward</p>
