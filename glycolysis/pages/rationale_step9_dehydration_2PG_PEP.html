    <p>Rationale<br>
      - Generate a high-energy phosphate compound</p>
    <p>2-Phosphoglycerate is not a good enough phosphate donor <br>
      &nbsp;- Two negative charges in 2-PG are fairly close<br>
      &nbsp;- But loss of phosphate from 2-PG would give a secondary alcohol
      with no further stabilization<br>
      <br>
      Slightly thermodynamically unfavorable/reversible<br>
      &nbsp;- Product concentration kept low to pull forward</p>
