          conversion of glucose to pyruvate cannot sustain living cells without
          the further conversion of pyruvate either by respiration or
          fermentation. What is the main reason?</font></font></p>

    Explanation:
    <p class="western">The oxidation of glucose to 2 molecules of
      pyruvate also produces 2 ATP and 2 NADH. This represents a much
      smaller ATP yield than what can be achieved when glycolysis is
      coupled to respiration (2 vs. 30-32 ATP per glucose). Glycolysis
      alone can be sufficient to maintain cells and fuel cell growth with
      this ATP yield...provided that the cell has a means to re-oxidize the
      NADH formed to NAD<sup><font style="font-size: 9pt" size="2">+</font></sup>
      for subsequent glycolysis. In the absence of a pathway to regenerate
      NAD<sup><font style="font-size: 9pt" size="2">+</font></sup>,
      glycolysis will rapidly stall out.</p>
    <p class="western">Organisms have at least one of several different
      fermentation pathways available for the simultaneous reduction of
      pyruvate and oxidation of NADH (see Figure 12.3 for several
      examples), all of which achieve modest energy yields with no net
      change in oxidation of the carbon substrate while maintaining a
      steady-state concentration of NAD<sup><font style="font-size: 9pt" size="2">+</font></sup>.</p>

    <p class="western">One consequence of starvation is a reduction in muscle
      mass. What happens to the muscle proteins?</p>
    <p class="western">Answer: Muscle proteins are selectively degraded by
      proteases in myocytes, and the resulting amino acids move, in the blood
      stream, from muscle to liver. In the liver, glucogenic amino acids are the
      starting materials for gluconeogenesis, to provide glucose for export to
      the brain (which cannot use fatty acids as fuel).</p>

    <p class="western">Why is it important that gluconeogenesis is not the exact
      reversal of glycolysis?</p>
    <p class="western">ANswer:If gluconeogenesis were simply the reaction of
      glycolysis in reverse, the process would be energetically unfeasible,
      because of the three reactions with large, negative standard free-energy
      changes in the glycolytic(catabolic) direction. Furthermore, if the same
      enzymes were used for all reactions in the two pathways, it would be
      impossible to regulate the two processes separately; anything that
      stimulated or inhibited the forward reaction for a given enzyme would
      stimulate or inhibit the reverse reaction to the same extent. </p>
