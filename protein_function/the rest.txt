    Spectroscopic Detection of Oxygen Binding to Myoglobin

--The heme group is a strong chromophore that absorbs both in ultraviolet and visible range
--Ferrous form (Fe2+ ) without oxygen has an intense Soret band at 429 nm
--Oxygen binding alters the electronic properties of the heme, and shifts the position of the Soret band to 414 nm 
--Binding of oxygen can be monitored by UV-Vis spectrophotometry
--Deoxyhemoglobin (in venous blood) appears purplish in color and oxyhemoglobin (in arterial blood) is red





Two Types of Immune Systems

    Cellular immune system

--targets own cells that have been infected, also clears up virus particles and infecting bacteria
--key players: Macrophages, killer T cells (Tc), and inflammatory T cells (TH1)

     Humoral “fluid” immune system

--targets extracellular pathogens
--can also recognize foreign proteins
--makes soluble antibodies   
--keeps “memory” of past infections
--key players: B-lymphocytes and helper T-cells (TH2)


Cellular Immune System

Antibodies bind to fragments displayed on the surface of invading cells
Phagocytes: specialized cells that eat invaders
Macrophages: large phagocytes that ingest bacteria that are tagged by antibodies

Humoral Immune System

Vertebrates also fight infections with soluble antibodies that specifically bind antigens
Antigens are substances that stimulate production of antibodies
Typically macromolecular in nature
Recognized as foreign by the immune system
Coat proteins of bacteria and viruses
Surface carbohydrates of cells or viruses
Antibodies are proteins that are produced by B cells and specifically bind to antigens
Binding will mark the antigen for destruction or interfere with its function
A given antibody will bind to a small region (epitope) of the antigen
One antigen can have several epitopes



Antibodies: Immunoglobulin G

Composed of two heavy chains and two light chains
Composed of constant domains and variable domains

Light chains: one constant and one variable domain
Heavy chains: three constant and one variable domain

Variable domains of each chain make up antigen- binding site (two/antibody)
Variable domains contain regions that are hypervariable (specifically the antigen-binding site)
Confers high antigen specificity, e.g. binding carbohydrote


Antigens bind via induced fit

Antigen binding causes significant structural changes to the antibody

Antibody specificity is an important analytical reagent

Antibody detection can be colormetric or luminescent, e.g. ELISA



    Protein Interactions Modulated by Chemical Energy

Use of chemical energy (ATP) can cause conformational changes in proteins, generally required for their function

Especially in motor proteins
Control movement of cells and organelles within cells

Allows for spatial and temporal regulation of interactions



    Muscle Structure

Muscle fiber: large, single, elongated, multinuclear cell
Each fiber contains about 1,000 myofibrils

Myofibrils contain thick filaments of myosin

Myofibrils contain thin filaments of actin

Myosin and actin interaction: Myosin thick filaments slide along actin thin filaments


    Actomyosin Cycle

Muscle contraction occurs through a series of conformational changes to protein structure due to binding, hydrolysis, and release of ATP and ADP
Cycle has four steps
ATP binds to myosin->  myosin dissociates from actin
ATP is hydrolyzed -> a conformational change of myosin
Myosin re-connects to the actin filament at a different location
    -> release of Pi
Release of Pi -> Power stroke where myosin returns to initial state; shifting actin filament relative to the myosin tail -> release of ADP

Actomyosin Cycle

Regulation of muscle contraction

Availability of myosin-binding sites on actin is regulated by troponin and tropomyosin
avoids continuous muscle contraction
Nerve impulse triggers release of Ca2+
Causes conformational changes to tropomyosin-troponin complex exposing myosin-binding sites

Sequence Similarity between Hemoglobin and Myoglobin


Functions of Globular Proteins -- Storage of ions and molecules: myoglobin, ferritin -- Transport of ions and molecules :hemoglobin, serotonin transporter
-- Defense against pathogens: antibodies, cytokines
-- Muscle contraction : actin, myosin
-- Biological catalysis : chymotrypsin, lysozyme


Hemoglobin binds oxygen cooperatively
Hemoglobin (Hb) is a tetramer of two subunits (alpha2beta2)
Each subunit is similar to myoglobin
