    <p><b>Spectroscopic Detection of Oxygen Binding to Myoglobin</b></p>
    <p>--The heme group is a strong chromophore that absorbs both in ultraviolet
      and visible range<br>
      --Ferrous form (Fe2+ ) without oxygen has an intense Soret band at 429 nm
      <br>
      --Oxygen binding alters the electronic properties of the heme, and shifts
      the position of the Soret band to 414 nm&nbsp; <br>
      --Binding of oxygen can be monitored by UV-Vis spectrophotometry<br>
      --Deoxyhemoglobin (in venous blood) appears purplish in color and
      oxyhemoglobin (in arterial blood) is red</p>

    <b> Two Types of Immune Systems </b>
    <ul>
      <li>Cellular immune system</li>
    </ul>
    <p> --targets own cells that have been infected, also clears up virus
      particles and infecting bacteria<br>
      --key players: Macrophages, killer T cells (Tc), and inflammatory T cells
      (TH1)<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> &nbsp;Humoral “fluid” immune system</li>
    </ul>
    <p> --targets extracellular pathogens<br>
      --can also recognize foreign proteins<br>
      --makes soluble antibodies&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      --keeps “memory” of past infections<br>
      --key players: B-lymphocytes and helper T-cells (TH2)</p>

        Immune System</a></p>
    <p>Antibodies bind to fragments displayed on the surface of invading cells<br>
      Phagocytes: specialized cells that eat invaders<br>
      Macrophages: large phagocytes that ingest bacteria that are tagged by
      antibodies</p>
    <p>Humoral Immune System</p>
    <p>Vertebrates also fight infections with soluble antibodies that
      specifically bind antigens<br>
      Antigens are substances that stimulate production of antibodies<br>
      Typically macromolecular in nature<br>
      Recognized as foreign by the immune system<br>
      Coat proteins of bacteria and viruses<br>
      Surface carbohydrates of cells or viruses<br>
      Antibodies are proteins that are produced by B cells and specifically bind
      to antigens<br>
      Binding will mark the antigen for destruction or interfere with its
      function<br>
      A given antibody will bind to a small region (epitope) of the antigen<br>
      One antigen can have several epitopes</p>

    <p><b>Antibodies: <a href="file:///home/ming/Dropbox/1.2_teaching_CHEM451/slides/protein_function/pages/immunoglobin_G.html">Immunoglobulin
          G</a></b></p>
    <p>Composed of two heavy chains and two light chains<br>
      Composed of constant domains and variable domains<br>
      <br>
      Light chains: one constant and one variable domain<br>
      Heavy chains: three constant and one variable domain<br>
      <br>
      Variable domains of each chain make up antigen- binding site
      (two/antibody) <br>
      Variable domains contain regions that are hypervariable (specifically the
      antigen-binding site)<br>
      Confers high antigen specificity, e.g. <a href="file:///home/ming/Dropbox/1.2_teaching_CHEM451/slides/protein_function/pages/immunoglobin_G_carbohydrate.html">binding
