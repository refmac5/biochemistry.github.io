    <p>Citrate synthase is also inhibited by succinyl-CoA<br>
      -Î±-ketoglutarate is an important branch point for amino acid metabolism<br>
      -Succinyl-CoA communicates flow at this branch point to the start of the
      cycle<br>
      <br>
      Regulation of isocitrate dehydrogenase controls citrate levels<br>
      -Aconitase is reversible<br>
      -Inhibition of IDH leads to accumulation of isocitrate and reverses
      acconitase<br>
      -Accumulated citrate leaves mitochondria and inhibits phosphofructokinase
      in glycolysis</p>
