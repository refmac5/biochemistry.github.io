    <p class="western"><a name="answer1"></a>The cycle can be envisioned
      as starting with the condensation reaction of oxaloacetate and
      acetyl-CoA. This is a highly exergonic and key regulatory step, and
      flux through the entire cycle is to a large extent determined by the
      concentrations of the 2 substrates. The citric acid cycle is also
      regulated allosterically at several steps by ATP and NADH, which are
      inhibitors.</p>
    <p class="western">Acetyl-CoA is a key substrate that feeds into the
      citric acid cycle and a key metabolic intermediate, but it is not an
      intermediate of the cycle itself. The net overall reaction of the
      citric acid cycle is the oxidation of acetyl-CoA to 2 CO<sub><font style="font-size: 9pt"
          size="2">2</font></sub>,
      with no net consumption of oxaloacetate.</p>
    <p class="western">No step in the citric acid cycle uses O<sub><font style="font-size: 9pt"
          size="2">2</font></sub>
      as a substrate; however, the entire cycle is indirectly O<sub><font style="font-size: 9pt"
          size="2">2</font></sub>-dependent,
      since the oxidized pyridine nucleotide NAD<sup><font style="font-size: 9pt"
          size="2">+</font></sup>
      is regenerated through the electron transport chain, which utilizes
      O<sub><font style="font-size: 9pt" size="2">2</font></sub> as the
      terminal electron acceptor. The cycle require 3 equivalents of NAD<sup><font
          style="font-size: 9pt" size="2">+</font></sup>
      per turn, and furthermore is allosterically inhibited by high
      concentrations of NADH.</p>

    <p class="western">The following are key features of the enzymatic
      steps above:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p class="western">Aconitase catalyzes the isomerization of citrate to
          isocitrate. In this reaction, the prochiral citrate interacts
          stereospecifically with the enzyme to produce only 1 of 4 possible
          diastereomers of isocitrate. Thus, although citrate is a symmetrical
          molecule, no scrambling of isotopic labels occurs at this step, due to
          the stereospecificity of the reaction.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="western">The α-ketoglurate dehydrogenase complex that
          catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of α-ketoglurate to
          succinyl-CoA is highly analogous to the pyruvate dedydrogenase
          complex. Like PDH, α-ketoglurate dehydrogenase utilizes TPP and will
          be inhibited by thiamine deficiency.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="western">Succinyl-CoA is converted to succinate in a reaction
          that also forms GTP (ATP) from GDP (ADP). This is the only
          substrate-level phosphorylation in the citric acid cycle.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="western">Succinate dehydrogenase catalyzes the oxidation of
          succinate to fumarate in a reaction that uses FAD as the oxidant. The
          enzyme is an integral membrane protein, also known as Complex II of
          the electron transport chain, and the FADH<sub><font style="font-size: 9pt"
              size="2">2</font></sub> formed in the reaction is reoxidized by
          ubiquinol as part of the catalytic cycle.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="western">Malate dehydrogenase catalyzes the oxidation of
          malate to oxaloacetate. This is 1 of 3 steps in the citric acid cycle
          that is coupled to NAD<sup><font style="font-size: 9pt" size="2">+</font></sup>
          reduction, forming NADH that goes on to the electron transport chain.</p>
