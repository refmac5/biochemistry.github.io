    <p>1. Individuals with a thiamine-deficient diet have relatively high levels
      of pyruvate in their blood. Thiamine is essential for the formation of
      thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), one of the cofactors in the pyruvate
      dehydrogenase reaction. Explain this in biochemical terms.</p>
    <p>2. What factors might decrease the pool of oxaloacetate available for the
      activity of the citric acid cycle?</p>
    <p>3. A eukaryotic cell can use glucose and hexanoic acid (C6H14O2) as fuels
      for cellular respiration. On the basis of their structural formulas, which
      substance releases more energy per gram on complete combustion to CO2 and
      H2O?</p>
    <p>4. Write the net biochemical equation for the metabolism of a molecule of
      glucose by glycolysis and the citric acid cycle.</p>
    <p>Glycolysis:</p>
    <p>Pyruvate dehydrogenase:</p>
    <p>Citric acid cycle:<br>

    <p>5.&nbsp;Would you recommend a person who has a diet with high protein,
      high fat and low carbohydrates to work out very hard in the gym? Explain
      your answer.</p>
