    <p>The extracellular space in the tissues of multicellular animals is filled
      with a gel-like material, the extracellular matrix, also called ground
      substance, which holds the cells together and provides a porous pathway
      for the diffusion of nutrients and oxygen to individual cells.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The extracellular matrix is composed of an interlocking meshwork of
      heteropolysaccharides and fibrous proteins such as collagen, elastin,
      fibronectin, and laminin.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>These eteropolysaccharides, the glycosaminoglycans are a family of linear
      polymers composed of repeating dissacharide units.</p>
