    <p>The fibrous structure and water-insolubility make cellulose a difficult
      substrate to act on</p>
    <p>
      Fungi, bacteria, and protozoa secrete cellulase, which allows them to use
      wood as source of glucose</p>
    <p>
      Most animals cannot use cellulose as a fuel source because they lack the
      enzyme to hydrolyze (beta1 - 4) linkages </p>
    <p>
      Ruminants and termites live symbiotically with microorganisms that
      produces cellulase</p>
    <p>
      Cellulases hold promise in the fermentation of biomass into biofuels </p>
