    <p>Glycogen and starch often form granules in cells</p>
    <p>Granules contain enzymes that synthesize and degrade these polymers</p>
    <p>Glycogen and amylopectin have one reducing end but many nonreducing ends
    </p>
    <p>Enzymatic processing occurs simultaneously in many nonreducing ends </p>
