    <p>1. Draw the structural formula for α-D-glucosyl-(1--&gt; 6)-D-mannosamine
      and circle the part of this structure that makes the compound a reducing
      sugar.</p>
    <p>2. Lactose exists in two anomeric forms, but no anomeric forms of sucrose
      have been reported. why?</p>
    <p>3. Gentiobiose (D-Glc(β1--&gt;6)D-Glc) is a dissacharide found in some
      plant glysodies. Draw the structure of gentobiose based on its abbreviated
      name. Is it a reducing sugar? Does it undergo mutarotation? </p>
    <p>4. Heparin, a highly negatively charged glycosaminoglycan, is used
      clinically as an anticoagulant. It acts by binding several plasma
      proteins, including antithrombin III, an inhibitor of blood clotting. The
      1:1 binding of heparin to antithrombin III seems to cause a conformational
      change in the protein that greatly increases its ability to inhibit
      clotting. What amino acid residues of antithrombin III are likely to
      interact with heparin? </p>
