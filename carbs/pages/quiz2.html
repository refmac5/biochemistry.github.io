    <p>2.The fructose in honey is mainly in the β-D-pyranose form. This is one
      of the sweetest carbohydrates known, about twice as sweet as glucose; the
      β-D-furanose form of fructose is much less sweet. The sweetness of honey
      gradually decreases at a high temperature. Also, high fructose corn syrup
      (a commercial product in which much of the glucose in corn syrup is
      converted to fructose) is used for sweetening cold but not hot drinks.
      What chemical property of fructose could account for both these
      observations?</p>
    <p>3. Gentiobiose (D-Glc(β1--&gt;6)D-Glc) is a dissacharide found in some
      plant glysodies. Draw the structure of gentobiose based on its abbreviated
      name. Is it a reducing sugar? Does it undergo mutarotation? </p>
