    <p>A protein with small oligosaccharides attached</p>
    <p>
      Carbohydrate attached via its anomeric carbon</p>
    <p>
      About half of mammalian proteins are glycoproteins</p>
    <p>
      Carbohydrates play role in protein-protein recognition </p>
    <p>
      Only some bacteria glycosylate few of their proteins </p>
    <p>
      Viral proteins heavily glycosylated; helps evade the immune system</p>
